                            <p>Some people take marketing campaigns very seriously. This is the case of Ruben Caradehuevo, a depressed man that sued McDonalds for about $1.5 million dollars because after he ate his happy meal, he was still depressed.</p>
                            <p>[…]</p>
                            <p>“I bought my happy meal, thinking that that would be the perfect solution for my depression”, Caradehuevo relates. He kept going: “I started eating and I was half way done, but my depression was still there”, he states. After finishing his food, the depression hadn’t still gone away, and he got really pissed.</p>

                                    <h3>Flight attendants get more uterine, thyroid and other cancers, study finds</h3>
                                </div>

                                    <p>A flight attendant's life may look glamorous, but the job comes with health hazards that go beyond managing surly passengers. As a group, they get certain cancers more than the general population, according to a new study.</p>
                                    <p>Scientists have long found that flight attendants get more breast cancer and melanoma. The new study, published Monday in the journal Environmental Health, saw the same trend and detected a higher prevalence of every other cancer the researchers examined: Non-melanoma skin cancer, uterine, gastrointestinal, cervical and thyroid cancers were all seen at a higher rate in flight attendants.</p>
                                    <p>[...]</p>
                                    <p>In Europe, flight attendants' exposure to cosmic ionizing radiation is monitored and limited more by law. There are no official dose limits for American aircrew. In fact, it wasn't until 2014 that US flight attendants got protections from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration like other American workers, but even today, those protections are limited, Mordukhovich said.</p>
                                    <p>"Our goal with this is to do the science and provide more evidence for policy-makers about this profession's health," Mordukhovich said. "We hope this helps."</p>
